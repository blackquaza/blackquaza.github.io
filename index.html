                        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                        <p>
                            My name is Dakota Blackwell and I'm currently a student at the University of the Fraser Valley, studying
                            for a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems, with a concentration in Software Development. Although
                            I've been at school for only a few years, I've been writing code for the past 10. I've already had one
                            co-op job thus far, and am looking to try a few more before I graduate.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What experience do I have?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started my journey with ActionScript in 2007, which is the scripting language used by Adobe Flash.
                            While the language itself is no longer used (with the retirement of Flash), it did give me my first glimpse
                            into Object Oriented Programming - the objects being the clip art and other items being acted on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2009 I took an online course for Java. While useful for coursework, I never used it to its full
                            potential until my first co-op with the government in 2019. Until this point, example code and assignments
                            rarely used Object Oriented principles and it seemed to have limited use. However, the programs used there
                            were written in Java and heavily relied on inheritence and abstraction. I'm now a firm believer in the uses
                            of OOP and write most of my new code using these principles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through my coursework, I also have experience with JavaScript and Python, though Java remains my preferred
                            language. I've also used C and C++, though I'm not as proficient.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Do I have any sample code?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I do! The Sample Code link in the top right corner will bring you to a page highlighting some of the code
                            I've written. You can also look at all my GitHub repositories by
